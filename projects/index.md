		<h2>3Daero.</h2>
		<h3>Additive manufacturing for the aerospace industry</h3>
		<p>My master's thesis focuses on reducing the notorious defects in FDM-type 3D printing via real-time control. I aim to develop aerospace-grade polymer brackets using a novel filament developed by the McGill Composites Group.</p>

		<h2>McGill Formula Electric.</h2>
		<h3>Formula SAE Electric (chassis subsystem)</h3>
		<p>I was introduced to the world of composite materials within McGill's electric racecar team. I learned the basics of laminate design and became familiar with the prepreg manufacturing process.</p>
